## Project Vision

When visualizing this project, we were inspired by the growing importance of using data to make smart decisions in online selling. As the demand for online markets continues to grow, it becomes increasingly practical for businesses to utilize a simple and user-friendly tool to understand crucial metrics like sales figures and popular products. This dashboard aims to serve as a valuable guide for e-commerce businesses, offering clear and practical advice derived from data analysis. It is designed to empower businesses to navigate the dynamic world of online selling with confidence, enabling them to handle challenges and seize new opportunities for remarkable growth and success.

## Background, Ideas, Goals

In the expansive realm of online commerce, a wealth of valuable information is routinely gathered, including sales data, customer behavior, and product popularity. Our mission is to create an analytical dashboard that is user-friendly and easy to navigate. The dashboard will provide data from WooCommerce, a widely used tool for online shops. This project aims to help businesses analyze their sales, understand their customers, and optimize their product offerings to increase sales and profitability. Additionally, the dashboard will enable online stores to track inventory levels and make informed restocking decisions. We will use Python, along with libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, to handle data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. The Axxesso API will be employed to retrieve necessary data.

## Intended Code, Environment, Algorithms, and Tech Stack

- **Code**: Python for its versatility and robust development platform.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Development Environment**: Google Colab and VS Code for seamless collaboration.
- **Data Retrieval**: Axesso API to access necessary data.
- **Analysis Techniques**: Descriptive statistics and clustering algorithms.
